# Exploring Java `String` Methods
Submitted by: Baruc, Jana Enigma S.

### Exercise 1: `length()`  - Finding the String's Size
1. **Prediction**: `The length of the string is: 14`. 
   * This is because the total number of characters in the string given is **14**. This includes the comma, the space, and the exclamation point at the end of the string.
2. **Observation/Output**

### Exercise 2: `charAt()` - Accessing a Character
1. **Prediction**: `The charcter at index 5 is: l`
   * This is because `String` has a zero-based index system. It also counts a space as a character.
2. **Observation/Output**
